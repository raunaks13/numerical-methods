Consider the following data of half-life (t12) vs. activity (A) of a radioactive sample.

t12(arbitrary unit)0,1,2,3,4
A(arbitrary unit)
100.0, 51.66, 26.41, 14.19, 6.45

Use Lagrangeâ€™s interpolation to compute A(t) for a given t. Take t as your input and print A(t) as the output. 
Your input must consist of one line. Round off your output to 3 decimal places.
